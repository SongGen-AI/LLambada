# Llambada-v0 üêë üéµ

‚ùóNote: This repository is in-progress for the final debugging, please wait until we release the full version 

Welcome to the official implementation of Llambada version 0 repository! This project provides the tools and resources to use the Llambada model, an advanced system for music generation.

- Paper: [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01661)

- Demo page: [Llambada demo](https://songgen-ai.github.io/llambada-demo/)

This model is trained on totally 4.4k music hours dataset with 2xA100 GPUS. The training cost for this model is about 720 USD in 5 days for 2 stages: the semantic stage and the coarse stage.

‚≠ê Hopefully, we want open the a.i for everyone, so all of the source code of the model, the training script, and the hyperparameters will be released :)

Please note: At this time, the repository includes only the inference code and pre-trained model checkpoint. Training scripts will be added in a future update.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Follow the steps below to set up your Python 3.10 environment using Conda and install the required dependencies.

Step 1: Create the environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate llambada
```
Step 2: Install dependencies
Install ffmpeg (for ubuntu, the script is here) and the dependencies.
``` bash
apt update && apt install ffmpeg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# üöÖ Training (Coming Soon)
Instructions and scripts for training will be provided in a future release.

# üñ•Ô∏è Inference
Utilize the pre-trained Llambada model to generate music easily.

## Checkpoint download

All of the checkpoints for semantic stage and the coarse stage can be downloaded in the [HuggingFace of SongGen](https://huggingface.co/songgen/Llambada)

### Pretrained setup

After downloading the checkpoints, you need to create the ```ckpts/``` folder, then you move all files to the ```ckpts/``` folder. 

Regarding the tokenizer ```bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz```, you need to copy that file to the ```/workspace/llambada_test/LLambada/models/base/tokenizers/laion_clap/clap_module``` for the setup.

## Running Inference

To run the inference, please run via the python file below:

``` bash
python infer.py
```

Create stunning music compositions with Llambada effortlessly!

Moreover, you can change the gpu for the inference via add this config to the front ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<your device id> ```

Total inference time for 10 seconds singing accompaniment is about 1 minute and 30 seconds on 1xH100.
